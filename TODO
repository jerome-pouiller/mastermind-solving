1. Algorithm is fast enough at begin, but very slow for last shots (see
   bestPlayerEnd). Currently EXTRA_PRUNE allow to speed up last shots. However,
   it may produce wrong results. A possible optimization would be to pass best
   score already found to getMin sub-calls. This parameter will ignored if > 0.
   Howver, if it is < 0 and minMaxDepth < -bestScore, do not go deeper in
   algorithm since we alread find a better path somewhere else.
2. There is a bug in bestPlayerNextTwoShots with printDepth = 3 and minMaxDepth
   = 1, but it seems to be a display error.
3. First call to getMin/getMax may display a progress bar
4. First call to getMin should use OpenMP
5. IDX_SCORE is not well named. In fact the only function that wait for Score is
   getBestShot() (and debug functions). In many other place, other kind of
   information is stored in IDX_SCORE.
6. In the old days, we filter results before to call computeSymetries. So it did
   computing only on valid shots. Now it compute it on all shots even if
   unecessary. In add, we cache this result, while finally, it is never used.
   We should remove computeSymetries() and include it in getNumRealShots() (we
   may keep cache if DEBUG is defined).  We may get 5 to 10% of improvements.
7. Implement and and use parseShot() and loadShots()
8. Use a struct for debug parameters
